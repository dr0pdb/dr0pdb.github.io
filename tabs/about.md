Hi! I'm Saurav Tiwary, currently working as an entry level Software Engineer at Microsoft in India. I've graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2020.

Previously, I've worked as an intern at Microsoft and Mindship during my undergrad years. I also participated as a [student developer](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5639603444776960/) in Google Summer of Code 2018 with Fossasia.

Recently I have grown a lot of interest towards Distributed systems and Systems programming. In distributed systems, I am mainly interested in distributed storage systems although I do find networking interesting as well. I've also been exploring the field of Programming languages and Compilers design and have been trying different paradigms of programming such as Functional Programming in Haskell and Erlang.
