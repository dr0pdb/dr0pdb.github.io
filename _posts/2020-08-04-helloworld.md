Hello world!

I have been meaning to write blogs in order to share my thoughts and technical knowledge for a couple of years now. Everytime I thought about writing, I always ended up deciding that my writing skills aren't good enought or I didn't have enough technical knowledge that I could share. With the passage of time I have realized that everyone has something to share. One doesn't need to be an expert in order to share their knowledge and learnings. So, after years of procastination, here comes the first article of many I hope.

For the rest of the article, I want to discuss about what you can expect from the blog.

I am mostly interested in technology specifically computer science, so the content will be primarily focused on it. I intend to share design decisions as well as implementation details of hobby projects that I work on from now onwards. I'll also try to share new things that I learn about the fields of my interest which currently are systems programming especially databases, distributed systems and programming languages.

Despite being in the nascent stage of my software engineering career, I hope I'll be able to share something useful for everyone.

See you soon!
