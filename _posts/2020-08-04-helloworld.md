Hello world!

I have been meaning to write blogs in order to share my thoughts and technical knowledge for a couple of years now. Everytime I thought about writing, I always ended up deciding that my writing skills aren't good enought or I didn't have enough technical knowledge that I could share. With the passage of time I have matured a little bit and realized that everyone has something to share. You don't need to be an expert in order to share your knowledge and learnings. So, after years of procastination, here comes the first article of many I hope.

For the rest of the article, I want to discuss about the type of content I'll be posting here.
